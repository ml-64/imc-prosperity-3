# imc-prosperity-3
 
These were our submissions for IMC Prosperity 3, a trading competition hosted by IMC. Team members included [Michael Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ml64/), Buck Arney, and Akash Deo.

Submissions for all rounds except for algorithmic trading for round one are attached in their respective folders. The submission for Round 1 is almost identical to the submission for Round 2, absent the inclusion of the new products introduced in Round 2.

The "Michael work" folder includes data analysis and code fragments written by Michael.
