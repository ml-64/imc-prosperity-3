So, they pick randomly, or they pick the highest value crate, or they pick a lower value crate because they think everyone else is picking a high value crate. I think in this case, we're screwed. I don't know if there's a way to think through this scenario - because it's hard to predict whether teams will trend towards picking the lower value crates or the higher value crates.\n","\n","I don't know how to prove that it's 'impossible' to predict which crates teams will pick. For instance, we could look at the discord channel and use that as an approximation, but since there's no incentive for teams to tell the truth in the Discord, I am reluctant to use that as a basis to make decisions.\n","\n","b) A team is thinking about the problem as a coordination problem. Then Michael's idea kicks in. Teams choose the cargos with the most profit. They switch to cargos that are more profitable. So, profits across cargos converge. Instead of saying the 'standard deviations of the cargos is minimized' - I suggest that we literally think the profits across the cargos are the same.\n","\n","This system of equations represents that. x_i is a number representing the optimal proportion of teams that picks the ith crate, and y is the profit of the crate.\n","\n","(Crate 1) 10/(1 + 100x_1) = y \\\n","(Crate 2) 80/(6 + 100x_2) = y \\\n","(Crate 3) 37/(3 + 100x_3) = y \\\n","(Crate 4) 17/(1 + 100x_4) = y \\\n","(Crate 5) 90/(10 + 100x_5) = y \\\n","(Crate 6) 31/(2 + 100x_6) = y \\\n","(Crate 7) 50/(4 + 100x_7) = y \\\n","(Crate 8) 20/(2 + 100x_8) = y \\\n","(Crate 9) 73/(4 + 100x_9) = y \\\n","(Crate 10) 89/(8 + 100x_10) = y \\\n","\n","\n","This is what Python fsolve produces:\n","\n","{'x_1': np.float64(0.018370221327861633), 'x_2': np.float64(0.16696177062331183), 'x_3': np.float64(0.07496981891332749), 'x_4': np.float64(0.03822937625685432), 'x_5': np.float64(0.1553319919548541), 'x_6': np.float64(0.06794768611594418), 'x_7': np.float64(0.10185110663970436), 'x_8': np.float64(0.0367404426560982), 'x_9': np.float64(0.16710261569210677), 'x_10': np.float64(0.17249496981993712), 'x_11': np.float64(3.5248226950308)}\n","\n","x = [0.018370221327861633, 0.16696177062331183, 0.07496981891332749, 0.03822937625685432, 0.1553319919548541, 0.06794768611594418, 0.10185110663970436, 0.0367404426560982, 0.16710261569210677, 0.17249496981993712]\n","\n","y = 3.5248226950308\n","\n","Really importantly, since y converges to ~3.5, far away from 5.0, it means that it's not optimal to pick a second crate!
